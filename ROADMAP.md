# kroopt ROADMAP — RFC Themes and Implementation Sequencing

**Project.** kroopt  
**Document type.** ROADMAP  
**Status.** Draft for implementation planning  
**Canonical source.** kroopt fixed requirements and external design  
**Primary rule.** Build the verified executable core first; attach crypto and real I/O only through a thin interpreter.  
**RFC management.** RFCs follow the [RFC lifecycle policy](rfcs/done/000-rfc-lifecycle-policy.md). The folder under `rfcs/` is the source of truth for each RFC's state; see [`rfcs/README.md`](rfcs/README.md) for the live index.

## 1. Roadmap intent

This ROADMAP decomposes kroopt into implementable RFC themes. The purpose is not merely to list features; it defines a safe development order for a Lean 4 TLS secure-channel library whose core value depends on proof/runtime correspondence.

The roadmap is organized around four risks:

1. **Model drift risk.** A clean proof model may diverge from the running TLS driver. Mitigation: a pure verified core emits actions, and the interpreter only executes those actions.
2. **Security regression risk.** TLS bugs often come from parsing, sequence numbers, nonce reuse, transcript mismatch, or terminal-state confusion. Mitigation: parser and record invariants are implemented before real network exposure.
3. **FFI trust-boundary risk.** The crypto implementation is borrowed from HACL\*/EverCrypt, but the FFI shim and secret lifecycle remain kroopt responsibilities. Mitigation: provider capability matrix, known-answer tests, sanitizers, and opaque secret handles.
4. **Integration pressure risk.** jemmet and iotakt integration could push shortcuts into protocol logic. Mitigation: runtime integration is delayed until the core, parser, record model, and fake harness are already working.

---

## 2. RFC set overview

The planning package contains **RFC 001–030**, in two waves:

- **Wave 1 — implementation architecture and protocol scope (RFC 001–016).** These derive directly from requirements §20 and define the core TLS architecture and the immediate implementation plan.
- **Wave 2 — cross-cutting security, lifecycle, verification governance, and release readiness (RFC 017–030).** These are net-new relative to requirements §20. They are not feature creep; they are the controls that preserve kroopt's verification and security posture once the core RFCs reach real crypto, real iotakt I/O, and jemmet integration.

Wave 2 was added after the requirements document was frozen. Per the RFC lifecycle policy, RFC numbers are stable and additive: RFC 017–030 extend the set without renumbering 001–016. Requirements §20 remains the canonical *scope* baseline for wave 1; this ROADMAP is the canonical *sequencing* baseline for the full set. See §11 for the reconciliation note.

## 3. Milestone summary

### 3.1 Wave 1 — protocol architecture milestones

> **Status (v0.3 socket arc).** The verified core + production interpreter now complete a full TLS 1.3
> handshake against **independent clients** — OpenSSL 3.0 `s_client` and Python `ssl` both negotiate
> `TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256` and reach `connected` (`scripts/tls-interop.sh`, RFC 026). The server
> presents the fixture Ed25519 certificate (RFC 012) and draws real OS entropy. Remaining for full v0.3
> acceptance: drive this over iotakt rather than test socket glue, exchange application data, and the
> a non-blocking readiness-driven reactor (`kroopt-live-server-nb`, the production I/O shape an
> iotakt adapter takes) and jemmet HTTPS E2E (RFC 015). An HTTPS end-to-end demonstration now works: curl and Python complete a real HTTPS request against kroopt (TLS 1.3 termination + an HTTP/1.1 200 response + graceful `close_notify`, `scripts/https-e2e.sh`), with a fixed in-tree handler standing in for jemmet — the genuine jemmet integration remains RFC 015's target.

## 4. Release staging

### 4.1 Internal M0 — executable verified-core skeleton

**Goal:** Establish the architecture so that the protocol model and runtime cannot split later.

Deliverables:

- `Kroopt.Core.Event`, `Kroopt.Core.Action`, `Kroopt.Core.State`, `Kroopt.Core.Step` modules.
- Initial `InputEvent`, `OutputAction`, `CryptoOp`, `State`, and `TlsError` types.
- A minimal `step` function with no real TLS logic but correct shape.
- Proof namespace and theorem skeletons for state/action discipline.
- Repository conventions: no project-local `sorry`, `axiom`, or `unsafe` in the proof/model area except explicitly documented assumptions (RFC 022).
- Cross-cutting foundations adopted early: threat model (RFC 017), data classification (RFC 018), proof-hygiene CI gate (RFC 022), and package/profile skeleton (RFC 024).

Exit criteria:

- Core modules compile.
- Model tests can call `step` directly.
- Runtime modules cannot bypass the core by design convention and module dependency rules.

### 4.2 v0.1 — synthetic handshake and record core

**Goal:** Finish the pure, testable protocol shape before real crypto and sockets.

Deliverables:

- Bounds-safe parser/framer foundation.
- TLS 1.3 record model with sequence, epoch, nonce derivation, and size budgets.
- Server handshake state machine without HelloRetryRequest.
- Transcript model tied to exact wire bytes.
- Fake crypto provider and fake transport.
- Deterministic full synthetic handshake test.
- Structural proofs for no early plaintext, no unauthenticated plaintext, legal transitions, terminal behavior, parser bounds, action discipline, nonce uniqueness, sequence monotonicity, and key separation.
- Resource-budget model over the fake transport (RFC 019) and the first parser fuzz harnesses/corpus (RFC 023).

Exit criteria:

- A full handshake completes over fake transport and fake crypto.
- Every state transition and terminal path has deterministic tests.
- All required pure-core proofs are complete or explicitly split into follow-up proof tasks with no runtime exposure.

### 4.3 v0.2 — HACL\*/EverCrypt FFI and real crypto provider

**Goal:** Attach real cryptographic primitives while preserving the core boundary.

Deliverables:

- Crypto provider trait/interface and capability matrix.
- HACL\*/EverCrypt C shim.
- Opaque secret handles and C-owned zeroizable secret storage.
- Known-answer tests for AEAD, SHA-2, HKDF, X25519, P-256 as adopted, and signatures.
- ASan/UBSan sanitizer jobs for the shim.
- Real AEAD record round-trip tests over fake transport.
- Native build profiles and feature gates settled (RFC 024); pure-core/crypto data lifecycle documented (RFC 018); crypto microbenchmarks begun (RFC 025).

**Status (M12, package 0.13.0-dev) — primitives layer delivered, integration pending.**
Done: vendored portable-C HACL\* subset built through Lake (`extern_lib krooptCrypto`); FFI glue and `Kroopt.Crypto.Hacl` wrappers; known-answer tests through Lean for AEAD (ChaCha20-Poly1305), SHA-2, HKDF, HMAC, X25519, and Ed25519 signatures (`kroopt-hacl-test`, 14 checks). Pending and scoped next: opaque-secret-handle **arena** and C-owned zeroizable storage; threading that state through `CryptoProvider.submit` so real key material flows through the key schedule (the pure handle-returning provider cannot do this alone — see `docs/src/crypto/native-crypto.md`); ASan/UBSan jobs; real AEAD record round-trip over transport; P-256; microbenchmarks.

**Status (M13, package 0.14.0-dev) — stateful seam + real key schedule delivered.**
Done: the secret **arena** (`Kroopt.Crypto.SecretArena`, generation-tagged, bounded); `CryptoProvider.submit` now threads it; the real TLS 1.3 key schedule (`Kroopt.Crypto.KeySchedule`) and arena-backed record AEAD (`Kroopt.Crypto.Real`) on HACL\*, **validated against the RFC 8448 §3 trace** end-to-end plus a real-key arena AEAD round-trip (`kroopt-keyschedule-test`, 20 checks). Handle opacity preserved; the 78 core theorems are untouched. Pending and scoped next: enrich the core `CryptoOp`/`CryptoResult` shapes (labels, input-secret handles, epoch-keyed key install) and re-prove operation-id correlation over them so `Kroopt.Core.step` drives the real provider — then a real handshake on one suite. Still pending after that: P-256, ASan/UBSan jobs, the iotakt `Transport` adapter, microbenchmarks.

**Status (M23, package 0.23.0-dev) — Ed25519 "defect" retracted as a false positive; corrected and interop-validated.**
The M19–M22 "non-RFC-8032 Ed25519 defect" was a **test-vector provisioning error, not a
HACL\*/compiler/Edwards-arithmetic defect.** The reproduction paired a non-RFC seed
(`9d61…7e8f`) with RFC 8032 §7.1 Test 1's public key (`d75a9801…`), which belongs to a
different seed (`9d61…7f60`); HACL\* correctly derived `bcd55c06…` for the seed it was
given. The earlier "isolation" steps were internally valid but all ran on the wrong seed,
so they only confirmed HACL\*'s self-consistency. Corrected this milestone: HACL\* Ed25519
reproduces the RFC 8032 §7.1 Test 1 public key **and** signature byte-for-byte, confirmed
independently by an RFC 8032 reference implementation and by OpenSSL `CertificateVerify`
interop (`scripts/ed25519-interop.sh`). The provision KATs now assert the real RFC vector
(`kroopt-provision-test`, 20 checks), vectors carry provenance + length discipline
(`Tests/Vectors/Ed25519Rfc8032.lean`), and the non-RFC seed is retained only as a labelled
regression vector. **No re-vendor, no compiler workaround, no trust-matrix downgrade**:
Ed25519 stays ASSUMED (inherited verified) with KAT + interop as TESTED evidence. Build
green, **87** theorems. (M24 closed the incident out with test-governance cleanup: false
language stripped from the changelog, provenance comments on every crypto KAT, and a
postmortem at `docs/src/crypto/postmortem-ed25519.md`.)

**Top pending — the structural-to-real handshake.** Now that Ed25519 is cleared, the real
next priority is replacing the structural placeholder frames and snapshot transcript with
real wire bytes and real transcript hashes, computing the real server `Finished` MAC, then
driving a full TLS 1.3 handshake against OpenSSL `s_client` / `curl` with an Ed25519 server
certificate (the `CertificateVerify` *construction* is already cross-validated against
OpenSSL; what remains is the live handshake).

*M26–M27 shipped the first increments:* `Kroopt/Parse/Wire.lean`, a real TLS 1.3
handshake wire serializer for the **whole server flight** (ServerHello,
EncryptedExtensions, Certificate, CertificateVerify, Finished), validated
byte-for-byte against RFC 8448 §3 (RSA cert/sig blobs treated as opaque, since RSA
is outside the vendored HACL subset). Two real-crypto joins are checked:
`SHA-256(ClientHello ‖ serialized ServerHello)` equals the RFC 8448 CH‥SH
transcript hash the key schedule derives over; and the **server Finished MAC**
recomputed over the serialized flight — `HMAC(finished_key, Transcript-Hash(CH‥
CertVerify))` — equals the RFC 8448 `verify_data`. Remaining for v0.3, in order:
sign CertificateVerify with kroopt's own Ed25519 cert key (RSA out of scope); wire
the serializers into the live handshake transcript (removing the `[snap.id]`
placeholders in `Core/Handshake.lean`); real record encryption; the iotakt
`Transport` socket adapter; then OpenSSL/curl interop. Still pending beyond v0.3:
P-256 (no `Hacl_P256.c` vendored — header only), ASan/UBSan jobs, and
microbenchmarks.

*The 0.35.0-dev architecture review (and the follow-up review of the RFCs) reset the
v0.3 finishing sequence into gated milestones (RFC 031–037). iotakt binding (RFC 010) and
external interop (RFC 015/026) are **frozen** until these gates pass, in this order:*

- **M36-prelude — honesty fixes (RFC 034).** Real provider advertises only the
  constrained capabilities (`realCapabilities`) with config rejection; entropy is
  fail-closed (typed `RandomResult`, no zero-fill success); deterministic/test randomness
  is separated from the real source. Small, no core/proof change, landed first.
- **M36 — production interpreter correspondence (RFC 031/032/033).** Typed handshake/
  record actions replace placeholder frames (no first-byte recognition, CI-gated);
  CertificateVerify/Finished are two-stage; transcript is over handshake-message bytes;
  the production interpreter drives the byte-accurate handshake over `FakeTransport` with
  a correspondence ledger + tests; the core processes protected handshake records before
  `connected`, with handshake-message reassembly and overlap-selection ClientHello
  negotiation; `Tests/RealHandshake.lean` becomes wrapper-only or is removed.
- **M37 — native and resource hardening (RFC 037).** FFI length contracts on all
  `uint32_t` params; secret arena native-zeroizing or truthfully classified; parse/
  handshake + crypto-op budgets charged in the core; record-size guards; sanitizer
  target; `close_notify` sealed.
- **M38 — constrained external interop (RFC 015/026/036).** Captured-ClientHello replay
  fixtures and a no-secrets trace harness; constrained `openssl s_client`/`curl`
  handshake green with archived traces; iotakt adapter begins only after M36 and M37 are
  green. Documented as a **constrained** profile, not browser-grade.
- **post-M38 — browser-grade crypto surface (RFC 035).** AES-GCM/P-256/ECDSA/RSA and a
  practical public-certificate story, only after the above are green.

*v0.3 phase kickoff — RFC 010 (ACTIVE): the verified core drives a handshake over a real OS socket.* RFC 010
unfrozen now that the M37 band landed. `Tests/SocketDriver.lean` (`kroopt-socketdriver-test`) runs the actual
`Kroopt.Core.step` + production interpreter over an AF_UNIX socketpair: a real ClientHello arrives from the
wire, the core (real HACL* provider, RFC 8448 fixtures) processes it, and the sealed server flight is written
back to the wire; the peer confirms a cleartext ServerHello record followed by encrypted records (outer 0x17),
the core reaches `sentServerFinished`, and a second socketpair completes the full round-trip to `connected` (peer puts a valid client Finished on the wire, the core verifies its MAC) — the full server handshake state machine over real kernel I/O. The server now presents its configured certificate (RFC 012): the public chain DER flows through one serializer into both the transcript and the wire, so the flight carries a real, non-empty Certificate — the prerequisite for interop with an independent client. Live interop is now real: OpenSSL `s_client` and Python `ssl` both complete a full TLS 1.3 handshake against kroopt (ChaCha20-Poly1305) **and** a post-handshake application-data round-trip — independent validation of the entire wire path, handshake and data. A first interop de-risk (RFC 026) confirms the core parses a genuine TLS 1.3 ClientHello from Python's ssl module — negotiating chacha20Poly1305/x25519 and producing a flight — so the remaining work toward live interop is socket orchestration, not parser changes. The interpreter stays pure — syscalls live in a thin
`driveOverSocket` loop (RFC 010 §6: the core decides legal writes, the driver only moves bytes). 24 suites
(+socketdriver) + 4 gates + fuzz + interop + sanitizer green. Next: round-trip to `connected` over the socket,
then OpenSSL/curl live interop (RFC 026) and jemmet HTTPS E2E (RFC 015).

*M37 RFC 037 slice 8 — ASan/UBSan sanitizer target (§7.5, closes RFC 009/024), M37 band COMPLETE → 0.48.0-dev:*
`scripts/sanitizer-check.sh` + `Kroopt/Native/kroopt_sanitizer_harness.c` build the real `kroopt_ffi.c` shim +
the HACL* sources it calls under `-fsanitize=address,undefined` (system gcc; the Lean-bundled clang has no
ASan runtime), linking the Lean runtime so the harness hands genuine `ByteArray`s to the shim. Two halves:
tight ASan buffer-bounds via direct HACL calls on exact-size malloc buffers (negative-control-verified: a
1-byte AEAD-output under-allocation triggers a heap-buffer-overflow), plus UBSan + KAT + fail-closed boundary
checks on the actual shim entry points. Closes the M37 native-hardening band; cut as **0.48.0-dev**. Deferred
(logged): C zeroizing arena, §4.1 crypto-op bounds + config-sourced limits, inbound alert level/desc parsing.

*M37 RFC 037 slice 7 (unreleased) — graceful close seals + sends an encrypted close_notify (§6):* the
server previously sent no close_notify (a graceful close dropped the transport in the clear, looking like
truncation to a peer). A graceful close from `connected` now seals a close_notify (warning, 0) under the
application write epoch via the same AEAD-seal action as application data; the `.aeadSealed` handler, seeing
a graceful close in flight (`closeState = .sentCloseNotify`), writes the record then closes. Proofs
(`appClose_no_emit`, ActionDiscipline/RecordPath cryptoResult cases) repaired for the new nested matches —
all stay true (a close_notify is callCrypto/writeTransport/closeTransport, never plaintext). 94 theorems.
`Tests/Correspondence.lean` (33 checks): core-level (inner `[1,0,alert]`) + end-to-end (sealed record,
outer 0x17, written before close). Inbound alert level/description parsing remains deferred. 4 gates + 23
suites + fuzz 40000 + both interop green.

*M37 RFC 037 slice 6 (unreleased) — secret-arena classification + terminal-path leak tests (§3):* closed a
live gap where nothing dropped a connection's secrets on teardown (`releaseSecret` was a no-op). A
`terminate` helper now drops every live secret reference via `SecretArena.bumpGeneration` on each terminal
path (`closeTransport` all modes, `failWithAlert`, `reportError`, the wrong-kind guard, oversize-record
failures); `releaseSecret` now honours the action. `Tests/Correspondence.lean` (31 checks) adds five
leak checks (graceful/fatal/abortive close, fatal alert, reported error → `liveCount == 0`). The trust
matrix (`threat-model.md`, `proof-assumptions.md`) classifies secret-memory handling honestly as
TESTED/best-effort/not-zeroization-guaranteed; the C zeroizing arena remains the deferred target and no
production zeroization guarantee is claimed. 4 gates + 23 suites + fuzz 40000 + both interop green.

*M37 RFC 037 slice 5 (unreleased) — `sealRecord` enforces the 2^14 record bound (§5):* `Record13.sealRecord`
rejected nothing and let an oversize fragment wrap through a truncating `UInt16` length cast. It now
rejects content above `maxRecordPlaintext` (2^14) before sealing, returning `Except ResourceLimitError
ByteArray`. Propagated without weakening security: `sealHandshakeRecord` returns `Except _ (Option
ByteArray)` (sealed / no-key-cleartext / oversize), `handshakeWire` keeps the keyless cleartext fallback
but turns oversize into a typed error, and the interpreter's `writeHandshake`/`writeCertificate` arms fail
the connection — an oversize message can no longer leak via the cleartext path. `sealRecord!` added for
known-small test fixtures; `Tests/Record13.lean` (13 checks) covers oversize-rejected + at-limit-seals.
Acceptance §7.4 met. Legit records unaffected; 4 gates + 23 suites + fuzz 40000 + both interop green.

*M37 RFC 037 slice 4 (unreleased) — ClientHello-bytes budget charged in the core (§4):* `onClientHello`
charges the ClientHello wire bytes against the ClientHello budget (16384) via the proven
`chargeClientHelloBytes` before negotiating — tighter than slice 3's cumulative total. Exhaustion fails
terminally with `internal_error`, no plaintext. The five proofs unfolding `onClientHello` (legal-edge,
no-emit/accept/aeadOpen, pending-plaintext) updated for the nested charge `match` (charge-error routes
via the already-proven `hsFail`); still 94 theorems, no `sorry`. `Tests/Handshake.lean` (12 checks):
oversized CH rejected (`failed internal_error`), normal CH under budget. Legit handshakes far under
budget; 4 gates + 23 suites + fuzz 40000 + both interop green. §4 remaining: extension-count (needs
parser to surface it), decrypted inner-handshake bytes, pending-ciphertext, §4.1 crypto-op bounds,
config-sourced limits.

*M37 RFC 037 slice 3 (unreleased) — resource budgets charged in the core: total handshake bytes (§4):*
`Core/Budget.lean`'s proven charge functions were never invoked by `step`. This wires the first in:
`RecordPath` charges inbound handshake-record bytes against the cumulative total-handshake-bytes budget
via `chargeHandshakeBytes` (limits = `ResourceLimits.standard`), threading `BudgetState`; exhaustion is
a terminal typed `resourceLimit` failure emitting no plaintext, firing before the per-buffer cap.
`Alert.lean` gains `alertForResourceLimit` (→ generic `internal_error`, non-leaky); `Proofs/Closure`
proves it fatal + not-closeNotify (94 theorems). `Tests/Correspondence` (26 checks) shows the over-large
input now fails via the core budget (`failed internal_error`). Scope: plaintext handshake path
(ClientHello + fragmentation); decrypted inner-handshake bytes, ClientHello/extension/pending-ciphertext
budgets, §4.1 crypto-op bounds, and config-sourced limits remain. Legit handshake unaffected; 4 gates +
23 suites + fuzz 40000 + both interop green.

*M37 RFC 037 slice 2 (unreleased) — §2 FFI length contracts complete:* extends validation to the
no-failure-channel primitives, which now return the empty fail-closed sentinel (the CSPRNG convention)
on a length violation instead of casting a bad length to `uint32_t`: `aead_seal` (key=32, nonce=12,
AAD/pt ≤ U32), `ed25519_sign`/`ed25519_public`/`x25519_public` (priv=32, msg ≤ U32),
`hkdf_extract`/`hkdf_expand`/`hmac256`/`sha256-512` (inputs ≤ U32, via a `len_u32_ok` helper). Guards
are unreachable for well-formed inputs — defense-in-depth at the trust boundary. `Tests/Hacl.lean`
(26 checks) adds five fixed-size negative cases. **§2 complete** (acceptance §7.1): every primitive
validates lengths and rejects violations — status-tagged (slice 1) or empty-sentinel (slice 2). KATs +
both interop unaffected. Remaining RFC 037: §3 arena classification, §4 core budget charging, §5
`sealRecord` size enforcement, §6 close/alert polish, §7.5 sanitizers. Proofs untouched (92).

*M37 RFC 037 slice 1 (unreleased) — FFI length contracts on the failure-channel primitives (§2):*
opens the native-hardening band that gates live-client interop. The shim cast every length straight to
the `uint32_t` HACL parameter; §2 requires validating before each call and rejecting (never truncating)
sizes that violate the fixed shape or the `uint32_t` bound. This slice covers the three attacker-facing
primitives with an existing failure channel — additive, fails closed: `aead_open` (key=32, nonce=12,
AAD/msg ≤ `UINT32_MAX` → status 1 → `none`), `x25519_shared` (scalar/point = 32 → status 1),
`ed25519_verify` (pub=32, sig=64, msg ≤ `UINT32_MAX` → invalid). `Tests/Hacl.lean` (21 checks) adds six
negative-length cases. KATs, tamper rejection, and both interop scripts unaffected. Next §2 slice: the
no-failure-channel primitives (`aead_seal`, `ed25519_sign`, HKDF/HMAC/SHA, `*_public`) need a
status-tagged return or caller-side pre-check. Proofs untouched (92 theorems). 4 gates + 23 suites +
fuzz 40000 + both interop green.

*M36 RFC 031 MILESTONE (0.47.0-dev) — `RealHandshake` retired; the production interpreter owns the
real handshake:* the bespoke `Tests/RealHandshake.lean` RD driver (own flight assembly, transcript
substitution, record sealing — 461 lines) is **deleted**, along with its `kroopt-realhandshake-test`
exe. Everything it exercised is now demonstrated by the **production interpreter** driving the real
`Kroopt.Core.step` to `connected` in `Tests/Correspondence.lean` (25 checks). Shared real fixtures
moved to `Tests/RealFixtures.lean` (new `KrooptTestSupport` lib). Migrated, production-driven: wrong
client Finished rejected (real `verifyFinished` MAC fails → not `connected`); RFC 033 reassembly
(split-CH reaches same state, over-large buffer fails the connection, `frameHandshakeMessage` unit);
DER cert-fixture integrity. Ed25519 CertVerify signing stays gated by `ed25519-interop.sh`; the record
layer by `record-interop.sh`. Architecture docs repointed. No production change — a test-tree
consolidation. 4 gates (92 theorems) + 23 suites + fuzz 40000 + both interop green. **RFC 031 slices
1–9 + the driver-removal criterion land the correspondence substance** (real records §2, core transcript
authority §3, §4 wrong-kind guard, §6 suite with negative-bypass set, §5/§7.5 removal). The §5 runtime
ledger and async §4 refinements remain deferred to the async-crypto work, where their negative-space
value first applies; the synchronous interpreter's properties are already pinned by the direct §6 checks.

 two more interpreter-level §6 checks. `Tests/Correspondence.lean` (20 checks): check 19
(an app send before `connected` accepts zero plaintext — `acceptedBytes == 0`, the core fails the send
and emits no `acceptPlaintextBytes`), check 20 (an app send after a graceful close likewise accepts
zero plaintext). With slice 8 (wrong-kind result → terminal; no early plaintext emit), the §6 set now
covers the core bypass surfaces: wrong-kind results, early plaintext emission, and early/after-close
plaintext acceptance. No production change. Proofs untouched (92 theorems); `conn`/`https`/`e2e`
unaffected. 4 gates + 24/24 suites + fuzz 40000 + both interop green. No release: the correspondence
ledger (§5), the async §4 refinements, and reducing `RealHandshake` remain.

*M36 RFC 031 slice 8 (unreleased) — §4 wrong-kind crypto-result guard tested + first §6 negative-bypass
checks:* the interpreter's §4 wrong-kind guard (`resultMatchesKind`, in the `callCrypto` arm) — which
terminates with an internal-invariant failure rather than forward a provider result whose kind cannot
answer the requested op — now has correspondence coverage. `Tests/Correspondence.lean` (18 checks):
check 16 (a signature result for an ECDHE op → terminal internal-invariant, nothing forwarded),
check 17 (a correct-kind result is forwarded, no termination), check 18 §6 (no application plaintext
emitted before `connected`, through the full server flight). No production change — tests pin existing
behaviour. Proofs untouched (92 theorems); `conn`/`https`/`e2e` unaffected. 4 gates + 24/24 suites +
fuzz 40000 + both interop green. The remaining §4 refinements (duplicate→fatal, stale→ignored+metric,
after-terminal→released) concern asynchronous crypto results the synchronous interpreter never
produces, so they land with async crypto. No release: those, the correspondence ledger (§5), the rest
of §6, and reducing `RealHandshake` remain.

*M36 RFC 031 slice 7 (unreleased) — complete the post-`connected` application-data wire path:* a real
application send now produces a real `TLSCiphertext` record through the production interpreter.
`handleAppSend` seals under the current write sequence and advances afterwards, so the first app
record uses seq 0 not 1 (RFC 8446 §5.3); the state still advances one per record so the
nonce/sequence proofs are unchanged. The interpreter's `writeTransport` arm — emitted only for sealed
app ciphertext — frames it as a record by prepending the 5-byte header (`Record13.recordAAD`, identical
to the AEAD AAD), so all record framing lives in the interpreter alongside the handshake flight.
`Tests/Correspondence.lean` (15 checks): check 15 drives a real app send, captures the record, and
opens it with `Record13.openRecord` at seq 0 to recover the plaintext — exercising the sequence fix,
framing, and AAD together. `conn`/`https`/`e2e` unaffected; proofs untouched (92 theorems). 4 gates +
24/24 suites + fuzz 40000 + both interop green. No release: crypto-op-id lifecycle (§4), correspondence
ledger (§5), negative-bypass tests (§6), and reducing `RealHandshake` remain before the milestone.

*M36 RFC 031 slice 6 (unreleased) — symmetric aeadSeal AAD + post-`connected` app-data path scoped:*
`resolveRecordAAD` now binds the record-header AAD (RFC 8446 §5.2) for outbound `aeadSeal` as well as
inbound `aeadOpen` — reconstructed from the on-wire ciphertext length (`plaintext.size + 16`, matching
`Record13.sealRecord`). `Tests/Correspondence.lean` (14 checks): check 14 asserts the bound AAD
(also confirmed by a real-send crypto round-trip during development). Driving a real application send
through production surfaced that the post-`connected` app-data *wire* path is incomplete independent
of the AAD: the core's `aeadSealed` handler writes the bare sealed bytes with **no record header**,
and `handleAppSend` advances the write sequence before sealing so the first app record uses seq 1
instead of 0 (TLS 1.3 violation) — both masked by the fake provider. Completing that path
(record-header framing for app ciphertext + the first-record sequence, with a full-record round-trip
test) is the next slice. Proofs untouched (92 theorems); `conn`/`https`/`e2e` unaffected. 4 gates +
24/24 suites + fuzz 40000 + both interop green. No release: the app-data path, crypto-op-id lifecycle
(§4), correspondence ledger (§5), negative-bypass tests (§6), and reducing `RealHandshake` remain.

*M36 RFC 031 slice 5 (unreleased) — the production interpreter drives a full real handshake to
`connected` (§6.1/§7.2 headline):* given a real crypto provider, `driveEvents` now takes an inbound
ClientHello to `connected` with real ECDHE, HKDF, an Ed25519 CertificateVerify, Finished MACs, real
record sealing, and a real inbound AEAD-open of the client Finished — no test-driver substitution at
any step. `Tests/Correspondence.lean` (13 checks): check 12 reaches `connected`; check 13 asserts the
wire flight is a cleartext ServerHello record + four sealed records. Driving a real sealed record
through production surfaced an inbound AEAD-open AAD bug — the core hands `aeadOpen` an empty AAD while
the seal side binds the record header (RFC 8446 §5.2) — fixed in the interpreter (`resolveRecordAAD`
reconstructs the header AAD from the ciphertext length, mirroring `Record13.recordAAD`); the fake
provider ignores AAD so `conn`/`https`/`e2e` are unaffected. Proofs untouched (92 theorems). 4 gates
+ 24/24 suites + fuzz 40000 + both interop green. No release: the crypto-op-id lifecycle (§4),
correspondence ledger (§5), negative-bypass tests (§6), and reducing `RealHandshake` (§5) remain
before the RFC 031 milestone. Next: the symmetric post-`connected` `aeadSeal` AAD, then §4/§5/§6.

*M36 RFC 031 slice 4 (unreleased) — the interpreter hashes the core's carried transcript prefix:*
The production interpreter now resolves every transcript-bound crypto op by hashing the prefix
bytes the core carried in it (slice 3), and drops its own transcript accumulation
(`RuntimeState.transcript` removed). This eliminates the slice-1 outbound-only accumulation that
was missing the inbound ClientHello, so the production path is hashed over the complete,
ClientHello-inclusive transcript — the precondition for correct signatures/MACs against the real
provider. `resolveCryptoTranscript` is now parameterless over the runtime and simply hashes the
op's carried field; the interpreter is a pure hasher over core-supplied bytes.
`Tests/Correspondence.lean` (11 checks) updated so the resolution checks feed a known carried
prefix and assert the SHA-256 of exactly those bytes. `conn`/`https`/`e2e` unchanged (fake
provider ignores the hash; the core-carried prefix is correct in the fake flow too). Proofs
untouched (92 theorems). 4 gates + 24/24 suites + fuzz 40000 + both interop green. Next: the
§6.1/§7.2 headline — drive the full handshake through the production interpreter with a real-ish
provider (fixed server-random + real crypto) to `connected`, asserting the cleartext ServerHello
record + four sealed records; then the crypto-op-id lifecycle (§4), correspondence ledger (§5),
and reducing the test driver.

*M36 RFC 031 slice 3 (unreleased) — the core is the single transcript authority
(ClientHello-inclusive):* The verified core now carries the **exact committed transcript-prefix
bytes** in every transcript-bound crypto op, replacing the abstract snapshot id (`#[snap.id]`).
New `TranscriptState.prefixBytes snap` concatenates the wire bytes of the first `snap.eventCount`
committed events — the inbound ClientHello plus the server messages committed before the snapshot
— and the five op sites in `Core/Handshake.lean` (hs-traffic schedule, CertificateVerify, server
Finished, ap-traffic schedule, client-Finished verify) use it. This closes the gap where the
interpreter's slice-1 accumulation was outbound-only and dropped the ClientHello prefix; the
authority now lives in one place. The snapshot pinning is already proved correct
(`snapshot_eventCount`, `snapshot_then_append_is_before`), and the handshake legality proofs
discard the action list, so the 92-theorem audit is unchanged. `Tests/Correspondence.lean` grown
to 12 checks: driving the core to the CertificateVerify op shows its carried prefix begins with
the inbound ClientHello and extends past it (CH ++ SH ++ EE ++ Cert). Nothing consumes the bytes
yet (interpreter still resolves against its own accumulation; fake provider ignores the value),
so `conn`/`https` are unchanged. 4 gates + 24/24 suites + fuzz 40000 + both interop green. Next:
switch the interpreter to hash the core's carried prefix and drop the local accumulation — the
precondition for driving the production interpreter to `connected` with the real provider.

*M36 RFC 031 slice 2 (unreleased) — real record sealing in the production interpreter:* The
production interpreter now emits the real encrypted server flight — a cleartext ServerHello
record plus sealed EncryptedExtensions/Certificate/CertificateVerify/Finished protected records
(`Record13.sealRecord` under the server handshake-traffic key from the arena) — replacing the
test driver's message-type heuristic and self-tracked sequence. The write **epoch and sequence
are now core-authorized**: `writeHandshake`/`writeCertificate` carry `(epoch : Epoch)` and
`(seq : UInt64)`, set by the core (ServerHello `.initial`/0; the encrypted flight `.handshake`
at 0/1/2/3 — constant because the flight order is fixed, no HRR). The interpreter seals or
frames per that epoch via `handshakeWire`, while the transcript still commits the plaintext
bytes, so slice 1's single transcript authority is preserved and the wire carries real records.
`Tests/Correspondence.lean` grown to 11 checks (sealed records open to their plaintext, honour
the core seq, fall back to cleartext when keyless, keep ServerHello cleartext). Proofs untouched
(92 theorems; classifier theorems are binder-only). 4 gates + 24/24 suites + fuzz 40000 + both
interop green. Remaining RFC 031: drive the full handshake through the production interpreter
with the real provider to `connected` (the §6.1/§7.2 headline), the crypto-op-id lifecycle (§4),
the correspondence ledger (§5) + negative-bypass tests, and reducing `Tests/RealHandshake.lean`
to a wrapper.

*M36 RFC 031 slice 1 (unreleased) — single transcript authority in the production interpreter:*
The byte-accurate handshake begins moving from the `Tests/RealHandshake.lean` driver into the
production interpreter (`Kroopt/Conn/Interpreter.lean`). The interpreter now accumulates exactly the
serialized handshake-message bytes it writes to the wire (`RuntimeState.transcript`) and resolves
every transcript-dependent crypto op (`signCertificateVerify`, `computeServerFinished`,
`verifyFinished`, and the traffic-secret `hkdfExpandLabel` contexts) against the real `Hacl.sha256`
of those same bytes — the §3 single-transcript-authority contract, with the wire bytes and the
hashed bytes proven to be one sequence. The flow timing means the *current* accumulated transcript
is always at the correct point for each op, so no snapshot-id mapping is required. New
`Tests/Correspondence.lean` (RFC 031 §6, grows with the RFC): 7 checks. Importing the HACL FFI into
the widely-imported interpreter required `-Wl,--gc-sections` on the interpreter-driving exes. No
behaviour change for the fake-provider `conn`/`https` suites; proofs untouched (92 theorems). 4
gates + 24/24 suites + fuzz 40000 + both interop green. Remaining RFC 031 slices: real record
sealing + inbound client-Finished open (reach `connected` with the real provider in production),
crypto-op-id lifecycle (§4), correspondence ledger (§5) + negative-bypass tests, and reducing the
test driver to a wrapper.

*M36 RFC 032 RESOLVED (0.46.0-dev) — §5 transcript over serialized bytes + §7 CI gate:* The core
now commits the typed serialization of each server-flight message to the transcript
(`serializeHandshakeOut` / `serializeServerCertificate`) instead of the abstract `frame*`
placeholders, which are removed; each message is built once and used for both the transcript and the
emitted action, so they agree by construction (the §15.6 transcript guarantee now reads over
serialized handshake-message bytes). `scripts/check-no-placeholder.sh` (§7) fails the build on any
placeholder framer / first-byte handshake dispatch in production; the dead `appendReal` first-byte
path is gone from the test driver too. **RFC 032 is resolved and moved to `rfcs/done/`** (the
"no-first-byte-dispatch" milestone). 92 public theorems, axiom-clean; 4 gates + 24/24 suites + fuzz +
interop green. The Certificate's real DER is deferred to RFC 031 (the core commits an empty chain,
matching the emitted action), which now also carries production-interpreter byte-accuracy.

*M36 RFC 032 slice 4d (unreleased) — typed Finished action (ALL 5 flight messages typed):*
The server Finished verify_data is now computed by a purpose-typed core op
(`CryptoOp.computeServerFinished` → `CryptoResult.finishedMac`), the write-secret mirror of
`verifyFinished`. A new `requestedServerFinishedMac` phase sits between CertificateVerify and the
app-key stage: `onCertVerifySigned` snapshots the transcript through CertificateVerify and requests
the MAC; `onServerFinishedMac` commits Finished, resumes the app-key schedule through Finished, and
emits the typed `finished` action carrying the core-computed verify_data. The real provider computes
HMAC(server_finished_key, H) over the write handshake-traffic secret. **All five server-flight
messages are now typed (SH, EE, Cert, CV, Finished) — no production path recognizes any by a first
byte.** Theorem set +1 public (`onServerFinishedMac_legal`, 92), axiom-clean; 24/24 suites; real and
production interpreters complete with the core-computed Finished MAC. Remaining before the milestone
release: §5 transcript restatement (typed serialization into the transcript instead of `frame*`
placeholders) and the §7 CI gate forbidding placeholder/first-byte dispatch, plus removing the now-
dead `appendReal` first-byte path in the test driver.

*M36 RFC 032 slice 4c (unreleased) — typed ServerHello action (4 of 5 flight messages typed):*
With the share (4a) and Random (4b) core-held, `onEcdheDone` now emits a typed
`HandshakeOut.serverHello` (Random + share + suite/group/version as wire code points) via
`writeHandshake`, serialized by `Wire.serverHello`. Added `cipherSuiteToU16` / `namedGroupToU16`
encoders. ServerHello is no longer recognized by a first byte anywhere on the production path. The
real driver now commits ServerHello **in the clear** (no seal) and fixes the CH‥SH transcript hash;
the dead first-byte tag-2 path is gone, and the test server Random is a wire-correct 32 bytes.
Proofs unchanged (91, axiom-clean); realhandshake (30) confirms the emitted SH equals the
independently assembled real ServerHello. Now typed: ServerHello, EncryptedExtensions, Certificate,
CertificateVerify — only **Finished** remains (slice 4d: its MAC op). Then §5 transcript restatement
and the §7 CI gate complete the "no first-byte dispatch" theme → milestone release.

*M36 RFC 032 slice 4b (unreleased) — server Random drawn via a core op + a handshake phase:*
A new `requestedServerRandom` phase sits between the ClientHello and ECDHE: `onClientHello` stores
the client share and requests a `randomBytes 32` op; `onServerRandomDone` records the drawn Random
and then requests ECDHE. The server Random is now a **core value** from the CSPRNG (RFC 032 §3),
not interpreter-invented — the second ServerHello prerequisite. The `randomBytes` result, formerly
a no-op at the correlation layer, is routed into the handshake gating dispatch. Entropy remains an
IO/interpreter concern (RFC 034): the pure provider errors on `randomBytes`; the driver supplies
the fixed test Random. Proofs unchanged (91, axiom-clean) via new `onServerRandomDone`
no-emit/no-accept lemmas; realhandshake +1 (30) asserts the core holds the drawn Random; the manual
phase trace now includes `requestedServerRandom`. Next (slice 4c): the typed `serverHello` action
(`Wire.serverHello`) + suite/group→`UInt16` encoders + the driver's plaintext no-seal SH path
(and a wire-faithful 32-byte Random); then Finished (MAC op), §5 transcript, §7 CI gate → release.

*M36 RFC 032 slice 4a (unreleased) — server ECDHE share captured into the core:* `onEcdheDone`
now keeps the server's x25519 public share from the `ecdheComplete` result (it was being
discarded) in `NegotiationState.serverShare`. This is the prerequisite for emitting ServerHello as
a typed action — the share is now a core fact rather than an interpreter-invented value. Proofs
unchanged (91, axiom-clean); realhandshake +1 (29) asserts the capture and that it matches the
interpreter's view. Next toward the typed ServerHello: a server-random crypto op + handshake phase
(random as a core value), then the `serverHello` typed action; then Finished (MAC op), the §5
transcript restatement, and the §7 CI gate. **Release policy: now milestone-based** — these RFC 032
slices accumulate under CHANGELOG "Unreleased" and are cut as one versioned release when the
"all five server-flight messages typed + CI gate" theme completes (or RFC 032 fully resolves).

*M36 RFC 032 slice 3 shipped — typed Certificate action (0.45.0-dev):* Certificate becomes a
typed `OutputAction.writeCertificate (chain)` — a distinct action (not a `HandshakeOut` case)
because the core holds only an opaque `CertificateChainHandle` (no DER), so the interpreter owns
DER resolution (RFC 032 §4). `step` emits `writeCertificate (selectedCert)`; the test driver
resolves the handle to its real chain (byte-identical to the placeholder it replaces), and
production serializes a structurally-valid empty Certificate pending config-DER wiring (RFC 031).
Three of five server-flight messages now first-byte-free; proofs unchanged (91, axiom-clean);
24/24 suites incl. socket/wire. Remaining RFC 032: ServerHello + Finished (need server-share /
Finished-MAC crypto-op flow), the §5 transcript restatement, and the §7 CI gate.

*M36 RFC 032 slice 2 shipped — typed CertificateVerify action (0.44.0-dev):* CertificateVerify
joins EncryptedExtensions as a typed `writeHandshake` action. `onCertVerifySigned` emits
`writeHandshake (.certificateVerify <scheme> <sig>)` — the signature is already the core's
`signCertificateVerify` result and the scheme a negotiated fact, so serialization is authorized
by the typed write, not by bare result arrival (RFC 032 §4 two-stage rule). `serializeHandshakeOut`
gains the CV case + a `sigSchemeToU16` encoder; the driver refreshes the post-CV transcript hash.
Two of five server-flight messages now first-byte-free; proofs unchanged (91, axiom-clean); 24/24
suites. Remaining RFC 032: Certificate (interpreter owns DER behind the chain handle), ServerHello +
Finished (need server-share / Finished-MAC crypto-op flow), the §5 transcript restatement, and the
§7 CI gate.

*M36 RFC 032 slice 1 shipped — typed EncryptedExtensions action (0.43.0-dev):* the core
begins replacing placeholder handshake frames with typed actions that carry protocol facts.
`Core/Action.lean` adds `HandshakeOut` + `OutputAction.writeHandshake`; `step` emits
EncryptedExtensions as `writeHandshake (.encryptedExtensions <ALPN>)`, and a single pure
serializer (`Core.serializeHandshakeOut`) realizes the wire bytes — the production interpreter
and both test drivers call it via total pattern matching, so nothing recognizes EE by its first
byte. Action-discipline and transcript proofs hold unchanged (91 theorems, axiom-clean; 24/24
suites; flight still reaches `connected` with identical bytes). Remaining RFC 032 slices:
CertificateVerify (two-stage; sig already in-core), Certificate (interpreter owns DER behind the
chain handle), ServerHello + Finished (need server-share / Finished-MAC crypto-op flow), the
transcript-over-real-handshake-bytes restatement (§5), and the CI gate forbidding
placeholder/first-byte dispatch (§7, only once all five are typed). Then RFC 031
(production-interpreter correspondence + ledger).

*M36 part 6 shipped — handshake-message reassembler; RFC 033 COMPLETE (0.42.0-dev):* the record
path now reassembles handshake messages across records via a bounded `State.handshakeReasm`
buffer + `frameHandshakeMessage`, so a ClientHello fragmented across records parses correctly
(it was previously rejected as truncated). The buffer is a plain `ByteArray` with a runtime cap
(like `inboundCiphertext`) — the long-deferred `ByteArray.extract` size bound was a false premise,
since no proof reasons about its size. `kroopt-realhandshake-test` +3 checks (28); three synthetic
client-Finished fixtures and one malformed-CH fixture corrected (latent 2-byte-length malformations
the old lenient path ignored). No proof change (91 theorems). **RFC 033 (Real-Client Handshake
Processing) moves to done/ — Implemented (0.42.0-dev), all six M36 parts complete** (protected
client Finished in-core, capability-bound negotiation of all three parameters, ClientHello
strictness, CCS window, reassembler). RFC counts: done 22, proposed 16. Critical path now: RFC 032
(typed actions), then RFC 031 (production-interpreter correspondence).

*M36 part 5 shipped — explicit change_cipher_spec phase window (RFC 033):* the record path
now confines a compatibility-mode CCS to its RFC 8446 §5 window — accepted-and-ignored only
during an active handshake (after the ClientHello, before the client's Finished), and
rejected before any ClientHello, after `connected`, or while closing/terminal. The payload
check was already present. `kroopt-close-test` +3 checks (19). No proof change (91 theorems);
the three theorems that case-split handleTransportBytes hold over the added branch. With
this, RFC 033 has one item left — the handshake-message reassembler — and stays in
`proposed/` until it lands.

*M36 part 4 shipped — ClientHello strictness on legacy fields (RFC 033):* the parser now
enforces RFC 8446 §4.1.2 invariants it previously ignored — `legacy_version` must be
0x0303, and `legacy_compression_methods` must be the single null byte (compression is
forbidden in TLS 1.3). `kroopt-hardening-test` +2 checks (18). No proof change (91
theorems). RFC 033 stays in `proposed/` — the handshake-message reassembler and explicit
change_cipher_spec policy remain.

*M36 part 3 shipped — cipher-suite selection bound to provider capability (RFC 033):*
`suiteOfU16` now maps only `TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256` (0x1303), the suite the vendored
provider performs, so `selectSuite` will not negotiate an AES suite kroopt cannot complete
even when the client lists it first. This fixed a latent inconsistency (the core was
selecting AES-128-GCM from a `13 01 13 03` ClientHello while the schedule used ChaCha20).
All three negotiated parameters — suite, group, signature scheme — are now selected from
the client's offers and bound to what the server can present/perform.
`kroopt-hardening-test` +2 checks (16); the e2e/conn negotiated-suite assertions updated
from AES to ChaCha20. No proof change (91 theorems). RFC 033 stays in `proposed/` — the
reassembler, broader ClientHello strictness, and explicit CCS remain.

*M36 part 2 shipped — signature_algorithms overlap selection (RFC 033):* the ClientHello
parser now selects the signature scheme from the client's offered `signature_algorithms`
(extension 0x000d), choosing Ed25519 only when offered, instead of hardcoding it; a
cert-authenticating server with no acceptable overlap (none, or only RSA/ECDSA) is
rejected (RFC 8446 §4.2.3). The constrained profile's interop limit is now explicit —
kroopt rejects the RSA/ECDSA-only RFC 8448 §3 ClientHello rather than presenting an
Ed25519 certificate the client cannot verify. `kroopt-hardening-test` +2 checks (14);
`kroopt-wire-test` updated to assert the rejection. Shipped alongside repo hygiene:
`.gitattributes` (vendored HACL* marked `linguist-vendored` so GitHub classifies the
repo as Lean 4), a rewritten README, and docs/src reorganized into
architecture/crypto/verification subdirectories. No proof change (91 theorems). RFC 033
stays in `proposed/` — the reassembler, broader ClientHello strictness, explicit CCS,
and suite-to-capability binding remain.

*M36 part 1 shipped — the client Finished opens in the core (RFC 033):* the protected
client Finished (outer `application_data`) is now opened **in-core** under the handshake
read epoch and routed through the handshake model to `connected`, with no out-of-core
decryption workaround; inner application data before `connected` is fatal. Read-epoch
correctness landed (read stays handshake until the client Finished verifies). Proofs
re-established (91 theorems): `buffered_plaintext_authenticated` + four preservation
lemmas, `KeySeparation.aeadOpen_uses_read_keys` (now read-epoch-relative), and
`Nonces.successful_open_increments_read_seq`. RFC 033 stays in `proposed/` — the
handshake-message reassembler, overlap negotiation, ClientHello strictness, and CCS
policy remain. `kroopt-realhandshake-test` grew +4 checks (25).

*M36-prelude shipped the honesty fixes (RFC 034):* the real provider now advertises only
`realCapabilities` (the constrained ChaCha/X25519/Ed25519/SHA-256, OS-CSPRNG profile),
`validateServerConfigCapabilities` rejects an out-of-profile config with a typed
`CapabilityError`, `Hacl.randomBytes` returns a typed `RandomResult` with the native side
failing closed, and `provisionRealConfig` fails closed with `entropyFailure`.
Deterministic randomness is confined to the fake provider. `kroopt-capabilities-test`
(8 checks); no core/proof change (87 theorems, 36 pure files unchanged). RFC 034 moved to
`rfcs/done/`. The next gates (M36 correspondence, M37 hardening, M38 interop) are as above.

*M35 ran a server flight over a real OS socket:* `kroopt-socket-test` seals the
server flight (cleartext ServerHello + four ChaCha20-Poly1305 records) and exchanges
it, plus the peer's encrypted Finished and application data, across an `AF_UNIX`
socketpair — confirming the sealed records survive real kernel I/O and open on the
peer. The socket glue is test-only; kroopt's core still performs no syscalls. This
de-risks the transport boundary ahead of the production iotakt adapter (RFC 010) and
a live `s_client`/`curl` handshake (RFC 015/026).

*M34 cross-validated the record layer with an outside implementation:*
`scripts/record-interop.sh` has Python's `cryptography` library independently derive
the traffic key/IV (RFC 8446 §7.3) and decrypt kroopt's `Record13`-sealed records,
recovering the exact plaintext + content type and rejecting a tampered record — so
the record layer is standards-compliant, not merely self-consistent (RFC 026,
partial). The remaining v0.3 work is productionizing the interpreter and the iotakt
socket transport (RFC 010), after which a live `s_client`/`curl` handshake runs.

*M33 made the presented certificate real:* the live handshake now presents a real,
OpenSSL-parseable Ed25519 X.509 certificate whose leaf key is kroopt's signing key
(`scripts/gen-test-cert.sh`), replacing the placeholder DER. `ed25519-interop.sh`
now confirms OpenSSL parses the cert, its leaf key matches kroopt's key, and OpenSSL
verifies a kroopt CertificateVerify under that extracted leaf key — the property a
real client relies on. This unblocks `s_client`/`curl` interop, which still awaits
productionizing the interpreter and the iotakt socket transport (RFC 010).

*M32 put the encrypted flight on the wire:* the live `step`-driven handshake now
exchanges real TLS 1.3 records — the server flight after ServerHello is sealed as
`TLSCiphertext` records (seqs 0–3) under the server handshake-traffic key, and the
inbound client Finished is opened by the interpreter, while the core works on
plaintext. The seal/open lives in the test driver where the production interpreter
will host it; records are still exchanged in memory. Next: fold this into the
production `Conn.Interpreter` send/receive path and the iotakt socket transport
(RFC 010), then OpenSSL/curl interop (RFC 015 / 026).

*M31 shipped real TLS 1.3 record protection:* `Kroopt/Conn/Record13.lean`
(ChaCha20-Poly1305) frames the inner plaintext, the §5.2 AAD, and the per-record
nonce into a real `TLSCiphertext` and back — round-tripped, with tamper/wrong-key/
wrong-sequence all yielding no plaintext, and demonstrated end-to-end protecting a
real application record under the live handshake's negotiated keys after
`connected`. Next: emit seal/open from the core's send/receive path and the iotakt
socket transport (RFC 010), then OpenSSL/curl interop (RFC 015 / 026).

*M29–M30 shipped the live wiring through to `connected`:* the verified core `step`
machine is driven end-to-end against the **real** provider with a **real
transcript** assembled by `Flight` (`Tests/RealHandshake.lean`). It parses the
ClientHello, runs real X25519 + the real key schedule, produces a **valid Ed25519
CertificateVerify over the real transcript**, and (M30) verifies a real client
Finished to reach **`connected`** — with a negative control confirming a wrong
client Finished is rejected. The transcript-hash substitution lives in the impure
driver, where the production interpreter will host it. A correctness fix keyed the
secret arena's base secrets by `(direction, epoch)` so the server verifies the
client Finished with the client (read) handshake-traffic secret. The verified state
machine and its 87 theorems were untouched. Next: real record encryption of the
flight (messages are still assembled in the clear), the iotakt socket transport
(RFC 010), then OpenSSL/curl interop (RFC 015 / 026).

Exit criteria:

- FFI KATs pass.
- Sanitizer-clean shim builds.
- Secret-bearing Lean types are not printable, serializable, or accidentally comparable.
- The verified core still has no direct FFI dependency.

### 4.4 v0.3 — iotakt integration and mainstream CLI interop

**Goal:** Drive kroopt over a real iotakt connection and interoperate with OpenSSL/curl.

Deliverables:

- `TlsConn` API with `recv`, `send`, `flush`, `progress`, `close`, `state`, `alpn`, and error inspection.
- iotakt interpreter for `OutputAction` execution.
- Non-blocking readiness handling: WANT_READ/WANT_WRITE mapped to iotakt readiness hints.
- Partial-write queue and bounded pending ciphertext.
- OpenSSL `s_client` and curl interop tests.
- Negative tests for malformed ClientHello, missing X25519 key_share, duplicate extensions, bad Finished, truncated record, oversize record, and post-close operations.
- Network-exposure controls current: resource budgets enforced (RFC 019), observability/redaction taxonomy (RFC 020), immutable config snapshots (RFC 021), negative/interop matrix (RFC 026), and the pre-exposure security review (RFC 028).

Exit criteria:

- OpenSSL and curl complete TLS 1.3 handshakes over iotakt.
- Application data matches plaintext both directions.
- malformed/hostile input produces deterministic alerts or typed failures, never plaintext leakage or crashes.
- No source change to iotakt is required.

### 4.5 v0.4 — jemmet integration and operational hardening

**Goal:** Serve real HTTPS requests through jemmet and harden browser-facing edge behavior.

Deliverables:

- jemmet connection abstraction integration.
- SNI/ALPN immutable config table and validated config generation, with reload (RFC 021).
- Server certificate/key presentation and CertificateVerify signing.
- Browser smoke tests (RFC 026).
- Fuzz harnesses for record, ClientHello, extension, and minimal DER parsing, mandatory in CI (RFC 023).
- Audit logging and redaction tests (RFC 020).
- Current proof/trust/test matrix; developer docs and examples (RFC 029); production-readiness runbook (RFC 030).

Exit criteria:

- jemmet serves an HTTPS request end-to-end through kroopt + iotakt.
- SNI selects the expected certificate configuration.
- ALPN result is surfaced to jemmet without giving kroopt HTTP policy ownership.
- Resource budgets and log redaction are tested.
- The release-readiness checklist (RFC 030) passes with no RFC 028 release blockers.

Wave 2 RFCs depend on wave 1 RFCs and on each other. They are mostly continuous
concerns rather than a tree, so the binding dependencies are listed directly. The
`**Depends on.**` header field of each RFC is authoritative; this is the summary
view.

## 6. RFC themes

### Wave 1 — implementation architecture

### RFC 001 — Boundary and non-goals

Defines kroopt as a secure-channel library between iotakt and jemmet. Locks down ownership boundaries, explicitly excludes raw socket ownership and HTTP semantics, and establishes the rule that changes to iotakt are not permitted for kroopt convenience.

### RFC 002 — Verified core and proof/runtime correspondence

Defines the pure core, `InputEvent`, `OutputAction`, `CryptoOp`, `State`, and `step`. Establishes the rule that the interpreter executes actions but does not decide protocol behavior.

### RFC 003 — Bounds-safe parser and framer foundation

Defines validated parsing for TLS vectors, record headers, handshake messages, extensions, and minimal DER metadata. Returns structured values only after bounds and policy checks.

### RFC 004 — TLS 1.3 record model

Defines TLSPlaintext, TLSInnerPlaintext, TLSCiphertext, encrypted outer content type behavior, record size limits, AEAD open/seal orchestration, partial reassembly, and plaintext buffering limits.

### RFC 005 — Nonce, sequence, epoch, and key-separation proofs

Defines directional epochs, sequence numbers, nonce derivation, overflow handling, and proof targets that prevent AEAD nonce reuse and key confusion.

### RFC 006 — Handshake state model without HRR

Defines the server TLS 1.3 handshake path from ClientHello through Finished, excluding HelloRetryRequest, tickets, 0-RTT, KeyUpdate, and post-handshake auth.

### RFC 007 — Transcript model using exact wire bytes

Defines transcript events, exact-byte binding, transcript hash update order, and Finished/CertificateVerify input derivation.

### RFC 008 — Crypto-provider capability and FFI contract

Defines the crypto provider interface, operation ids, result correlation, capability selection, error mapping, secret-handle API, and provider test responsibilities.

### RFC 009 — HACL\*/EverCrypt shim, KAT, and sanitizer strategy

Defines the native shim, build integration, memory ownership, known-answer tests, sanitizer jobs, and failure handling for HACL\*/EverCrypt.

### RFC 010 — TlsConn API and non-blocking iotakt interpreter

Defines public connection APIs, write/flush semantics, readiness mapping, pending ciphertext queue, resource budgets, and stale-event defense.

### RFC 011 — SNI/ALPN configuration model

Defines immutable validated server configuration, SNI matching, ALPN negotiation, listener generation, config reload semantics, and policy separation from jemmet.

### RFC 012 — Server certificate/key presentation

Defines configured chain loading, minimal leaf metadata parsing, key/certificate compatibility lint, CertificateVerify signing, and non-goal of peer path validation.

### RFC 013 — Alerts, close_notify, and terminal policy

Defines fatal alert mapping, graceful close, inbound close_notify, transport EOF, abortive close, terminal states, and post-terminal behavior.

### RFC 014 — Deterministic test harness, fake crypto, fake transport, and fuzzing

Defines the fake provider, fake transport, scripted model tests, interpreter faithfulness tests, and fuzzing targets.

### RFC 015 — jemmet integration and E2E acceptance

Defines how jemmet consumes `TlsConn`, how ALPN is handed off, how HTTPS listener wiring works, and what end-to-end tests certify readiness.

### RFC 016 — Deferred future TLS features

Maintains scope control for peer X.509 path validation, client role, mTLS, tickets/resumption, HRR, KeyUpdate, 0-RTT, TLS 1.2, QUIC, DTLS, and performance tuning.

### Wave 2 — cross-cutting controls

| RFC | Theme | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| 017 | Threat model and abuse cases | Keeps every later decision grounded in internet-edge attacker behavior. |
| 018 | Data classification and lifecycle | Prevents accidental plaintext, secret, transcript, and queue ownership bugs. |
| 019 | Resource budgets and backpressure | Prevents slowloris, oversized-input, and hidden-buffer DoS classes. |
| 020 | Observability and redaction | Enables operation without leaking secrets or attacker-controlled blobs. |
| 021 | Configuration lifecycle and reload | Ensures SNI/ALPN/cert policy is validated, immutable, and atomically reloadable. |
| 022 | Proof gates and CI | Preserves verification value by blocking model/proof hygiene regressions. |
| 023 | Parser fuzzing corpus | Complements proofs with hostile byte-level regression pressure. |
| 024 | Native build and feature gates | Keeps pure core, FFI, fake providers, and interop profiles separated. |
| 025 | Performance and memory benchmark policy | Catches pathological allocation/latency without weakening invariants. |
| 026 | Compatibility and negative matrix | Defines what interop is tested and how unsupported TLS features fail. |
| 027 | API stability and versioning | Lets jemmet and future iotakt consumers depend on kroopt safely. |
| 028 | Security review and vulnerability process | Defines release blockers and handling for TLS-layer vulnerabilities. |
| 029 | Developer documentation and examples | Teaches correct `TlsConn` progress, write, close, ALPN, and config usage. |
| 030 | Production readiness and release runbook | Gives a release gate for proof, security, interop, docs, and operations. |

## 7. Cross-cutting security decisions

These decisions apply to every RFC:

1. **No early plaintext.** Public read/write APIs must not expose or accept application plaintext before the core is connected.
2. **No unauthenticated plaintext.** Decrypted bytes are emitted only after successful AEAD open and inner content-type validation.
3. **No secret logging.** Secret handles, keys, nonces, traffic secrets, transcript secrets, and private-key material must never derive printable or serializable interfaces.
4. **No unbounded queues.** Input reassembly, pending output, handshake bytes, extension counts, and progress loops are bounded.
5. **No stale result acceptance.** Crypto results and transport events are correlated to connection generation, epoch, and operation id.
6. **No proof bypass.** Runtime code may not implement alternate state transitions outside `Kroopt.Core.step`.
7. **No implicit trust store.** Server mode presents configured material; peer path validation is future scope.
8. **No feature creep into v0.4.** HRR, tickets, 0-RTT, KeyUpdate, TLS 1.2, client mode, and mTLS require separate RFC approval.
9. **Secret-memory zeroization is staged by lifetime, and the two postures stay distinct.** Config-lifetime secrets (the server private key) are C-owned and explicitly zeroized now; connection-lifetime traffic secrets stay in the pure `SecretArena` with best-effort logical invalidation (generation bump on every terminal path) until the native traffic-secret arena lands. That migration is a **stable/v1 gate**, sequenced **after RFC 031**, specified by RFC 040 as a two-interpreter (pure model + IO production) architecture — it must **not** be done by IO-ifying the single interpreter, which would collapse the proof/runtime correspondence. No production zeroization is claimed for traffic secrets until then.

---

## 8. Suggested implementation order

1. RFC 001, 002: create the core shape and module dependency rules. Adopt RFC 017, 018, 022, 024 foundations alongside.
2. RFC 003: parser foundation before handshake logic. Begin RFC 023 corpus.
3. RFC 004, 005: record model and sequence/nonce/key proofs. Begin RFC 019 budget model.
4. RFC 006, 007: handshake and transcript logic.
5. RFC 014: fake crypto/transport tests; use them to drive the core before real FFI.
6. RFC 008, 009: crypto provider and HACL\*/EverCrypt attachment. Settle RFC 024 native profiles; begin RFC 025 microbenchmarks.
7. RFC 010: TlsConn and iotakt interpreter. Enforce RFC 019 budgets; stand up RFC 020 taxonomy.
8. RFC 011, 012: config, SNI/ALPN, certificate presentation. Apply RFC 021 snapshots.
9. RFC 013: alerts and close behavior across all paths.
10. RFC 026, 028: interop/negative matrix and pre-exposure security review before treating v0.3 interop as acceptance.
11. RFC 015: jemmet integration and E2E acceptance. Apply RFC 029 docs and RFC 030 readiness runbook.
12. RFC 016: maintain as a living backlog and scope guard throughout.

## 9. Management gates

### Gate A — model gate

No real socket and no HACL\*/EverCrypt FFI may be merged before the pure core compiles, the parser foundation exists, and the fake test harness can drive `step` directly. (RFC 002, 003, 014, 022.)

### Gate B — proof gate

No public `TlsConn` API may be treated as stable before the core proves no early plaintext, no unauthenticated plaintext, terminal-state behavior, nonce uniqueness, sequence monotonicity, and key separation. (RFC 005, 006, 013, 022.)

### Gate C — FFI gate

No real crypto provider may be used by default before known-answer tests and sanitizer jobs pass in CI. (RFC 008, 009, 024.)

### Gate D — network exposure gate

No iotakt network interop may be enabled by default before the interpreter is action-only, stale crypto/result correlation is implemented, resource budgets are enforced, and the pre-exposure security review is complete. (RFC 010, 017, 019, 028.)

### Gate E — jemmet gate

No jemmet integration may be merged as a default HTTPS path before OpenSSL/curl interop, negative tests, config validation, and redaction tests pass. (RFC 015, 020, 026.)

---

## 10. Deliverable definition

A roadmap item is complete only when it includes:

- implementation modules;
- tests;
- proof obligations or explicit proof deferral notes;
- documentation updates;
- proof/trust/test matrix update;
- security review note for any trusted or tested boundary.

"Works against curl" is not enough. For kroopt, each milestone must preserve the architecture that gives verification value.

---

## 11. Requirements reconciliation

The kroopt fixed requirements document (§20) enumerates RFCs 001–016. RFC 017–030 were added during planning as cross-cutting controls and are net-new relative to that list. This divergence is intentional and policy-compliant (RFC numbers are stable and additive), but it must not be silent:

- This ROADMAP is the canonical sequencing baseline for RFC 001–030.
- Requirements §20 remains the canonical scope baseline for wave 1 (RFC 001–016).
- The next revision of the requirements document should add a short note that wave 2 (RFC 017–030) exists as a continuation set, so the canonical requirements and the RFC index do not drift (RFC lifecycle policy "status fields that lie" and "letting cross-references rot" anti-patterns).
- Until that revision lands, treat any conflict between requirements §20 and the RFC set as: requirements win on wave-1 *scope*; this ROADMAP wins on *sequencing and the existence of wave 2*.

---

## 12. RFC lifecycle and this package

RFCs are managed under the [RFC lifecycle policy](rfcs/done/000-rfc-lifecycle-policy.md):

- All kroopt RFCs currently live in `rfcs/proposed/` because none has been implemented yet; the folder is the source of truth for state.
- When an RFC's work ships, it moves to `rfcs/done/` with its `**Status.**` field updated to `Implemented (vX.Y.Z)` in the same change, and `rfcs/README.md` is updated in that same commit.
- Withdrawn or superseded RFCs move to `rfcs/archive/` with a one-line reason.
- RFC numbers are permanent and never reused; cross-references use relative paths reflecting the target's current folder.
